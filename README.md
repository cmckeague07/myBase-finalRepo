myBase is a 
Stock portfolio application that allows users to manage their stock portfolios. The app offers real-time stock price updates via the Yahoo Finance API, and provides real-time profit and loss updates. Technologies used include Java SpringBoot, HTML, CSS and Javascript FrontEnd, MySQL Database backend and Yahoo Finance API. This tool was used as it is a free api that provides realtime access to stock data quotes. I developed this app mostly for for fun and for a challenge, it was a good learning experience working with the Yahoo Finance API and this is a project i am still working on adding new features.
