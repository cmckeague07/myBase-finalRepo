# myBase-finalRepo
myBase is a 
Stock portfolio application that allows users to manage their stock portfolios. The app offers real-time stock price updates via the Yahoo Finance API, and provides real-time profit and loss updates. Technologies used include Java SpringBoot, HTML, CSS and Javascript FrontEnd, MySQL Database backend and Yahoo Finance API. This tool was used as it is a free api that provides realtime access to stock data quotes. I developed this app mostly for for fun and to build my Java knowledge working with Spring & APIs.
